# Hack Language Specification

The easiest way to navigate the specification is via the [table of contents](spec/00-specification-for-hack.md).

You can run the specification tests with [HHVM](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/) via its [test runner](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/test/README.md) and the [Hack typechecker](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/typechecker/introduction) via `hh_client`.

Pull requests, issue filings and comments are extremely welcome.
